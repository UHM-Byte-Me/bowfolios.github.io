## Bowfolios

### Intro

Currently the project has several UI elements as well as the back end to support future development.
Current features include the ability for a user to sign up or log in, navigate between pages, create a their profile and add a project.

### Future development

We would need to implement the UI to display all the user profiles, projects, interests, and filter. We have the supporting back end to display the data, but we still need to implement the map functions.

Once we implement the above UI elements, we will edit the homepage to display examples of them, instead of placeholder images featuring the web version.
